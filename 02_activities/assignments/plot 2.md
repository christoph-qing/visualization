# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Final Project


    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    I used Excel to create my data visualization. Excel allowed me to quickly generate a box plot, calculate summaries. 
    > Who is your intended audience? 
    general audience who may be curious about population trends, as well as healthcare providers and policy makers who may use this information to inform planning and interventions related to maternal and infant health
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    The visualization is designed to show that stillbirths have a general trend to decrease over the year. By grouping the monthly counts into yearly summaries and plotting them as a box plot, viewers can clearly see the range and variability of stillbirth counts across months within each year, as well as the overall downward trend.
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    I focused on clarity and emphasis on trends. I used one color to make the box plots. I added a trend line to highlight the decrease in stillbirths over time. The layout is simple.
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    To improve reproducibility, I summed the stillbirth counts by month for all years before plotting, rather than manually adjusting each monthly value. This reduces the risk of human error. Excel is not fully reproducible like Python, small manual changes like chart formatting could accidentally alter the visualization. This could lead to inconsistencies if someone else tried to reproduce the exact plot.
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    The chart uses one solid color to ensure readability even for individuals with color vision deficiencies. Labels and axes are clear and concise, so viewers do not need prior knowledge to interpret the chart.
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    Healthcare providers can use this visualization to monitor trends in stillbirths and evaluate interventions. Students and researchers may use it as an example of population health trends or data visualization techniques. More broadly, policy makers can use the trend information to guide public health strategies or maternal health programs.
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    I focused on stillbirth counts because including births or deaths would make it difficult to visually compare trends as the magnitude of stillbirths is much smaller than live births or deaths.
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    I need to sum the stillbirth counts for each month across years to create a consistent dataset suitable for a box plot.
