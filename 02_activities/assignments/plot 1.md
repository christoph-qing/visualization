# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3 plot 1


  > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    I used Python

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    Students, researchers, and general audience
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    First is to highlight seasonal and yearly patterns in events. And then compare the relative magnitudes of the three events births vs deaths.
    
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    I chose clear line colors and labels in Python to differentiate each event for clarity. Added rotated x-axis labels, readable fonts, and a figure size that prevents crowding.Used consistent time scales across plots so trends are directly comparable.

    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    Python is reproducible, as the script can be rerun on the same dataset to generate identical plots.

    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    I used high-contrast colors for readability.
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    Families and communities could benefit from insights into birth or death trends for planning purposes.
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    I excluded stillborns because I included them first but then realized that the magnitude is so small so it's better to use another excel chart to talk about it specifically.
    
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    Cleaning and formatting the data by mapping month names in English/French to numbers. Creating a proper datetime column and setting it as the index.
